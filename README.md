# Penteract
Open-source Core-xy motion platform mainly for "large" print volume desktop 3D printer

---
# Introduction
The Penteract is a open-source Core-xy motion platform with a ridgid main chassis using 3030 aluminum extrusions and light moving compoents constuted by 1515 aluminum extrusions.

Due to the design being motion platform, components like the motherboard, build plate, LED lights, HEPA filters, etc. are for the individual builder to determine. in addtion, the "Penteract calculator" will output the length of components to accommodate various sizes requrents.
